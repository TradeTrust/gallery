# TradeTrust Gallery

This repository showcases a collection of TradeTrust-supported documents, including Verifiable Documents and Electronic Transfer Records. Each document features QR codes that link to [ref.tradetrust.io](https://ref.tradetrust.io) for easy verification.

The gallery includes common document types such as Certificate of Origin, Invoice, Electronic Promissory Note, Electronic Bill of Lading, and Warehouse Receipt. Documents are presented in different states (e.g., default, redacted, revoked, expired, operative, inoperative) to demonstrate real-world scenarios.

**Note:** These documents are for demonstration and testing only. They contain placeholder data and should not be used in production or as transaction templates.
